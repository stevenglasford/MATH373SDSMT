\section{Problem Statement}

Solve Kepler's equation, $E - e\sin{(E}) = M,$ when $e=0.048$ and $M = \pi/4$ using the methods of Bisection and False Position.

\section{Solution}

In order to determine an appropriate interval in which to search for a root, Kepler's equation was plotted for a range of $E$-values.  The results can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:kepler}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim={1.5in 3.55in 1.5in 3.25in},clip]{kepler_plot}
\caption{Plot of Kepler's equation.}\label{fig:kepler}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

An appropriate interval seems to be $[0.7,0.9]$, and the results of Bisection and False Position can be seen in Table \ref{table:kepler}.  Based on the methods, $E = 0.8205$ radians.  This value is reliable because the function value at the root is very small for both methods.  Also, the relative approximate error is small, and the methods terminated before reaching the maximum number of iterations, which is a good indication that the roots are accurate.

Bisection & 0.8205 & \num{2.3856e-07} & \num{9.2984e-05} & 18\\
False Position & 0.8205 & \num{-3.6131e-10} & \num{3.0810e-05} & 3\\

\section{Command-line Usage}

Two programs were written to solve this problem, and the command-line usage is below.

\begin{verbatim}
>> Kepler_plot()

>> data = Kepler_problem()
\end{verbatim}

\section{Code}

The code for plotting Kepler's equation can be found in Listing \ref{code:plot}.  A program was written to solve this problem, called \texttt{Kepler\_problem}, and the code can be found in Listing \ref{code:problem}.  Note that \texttt{Kepler\_problem} calls the programs \texttt{bisection} and \texttt{false\_position}, but they are not included in this document.
